# HollywoodMovies2.0

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#stable)
<!-- badges: end -->

HollywoodMovies2.0 is a Shiny app that has been re-built using `golem` framework. Among many other benefits, `golem` builds a Shiny app as an R package thus it's quite easy to ensure the robustness of the application. Learn more here about `golem`. 

The primary goal of this HollywoodMovies2.0 is to use Shiny to achieve two things:

* Interactively explore the data, and
* Enabling user to interact with an algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to have a better understanding of the data and the KNN model.

## Description of the App

This application has three tabs. The main contents are presented in the tabs. Other than the tabs, the sidebar  serves two purposes:

* Works as a tab navigation panel,
* Provides users a way to select movie genre(s) that they would like to explore.


Here's a brief summary about what tasks can be performed in each of the tabs:

**Summary:**  

* Top 4 boxes gives a summary of _Highest Grossing_ and _Highest Profit_ generating movie title and director name,
* The first bar plot shows yearly total movie production numbers. Users can zoom in on this plot and see the zoomed-in plot on right,
* The second plot bar is the zoomed-in plot,
* The boxes at the bottom provide median value of _Gross Earning_, _Gross Budget_, _Gross Profit_, and _User Rating_ of the movies selected by the users. The color of the boxes represents a comparison between the overall performance of all movies across all genres vs the performance of the movies from the genre selected by the user.

**Bivariate Relations:**

* The plot shows a scatter plot for the two variables selected by the users using the selectors on the right pane. Users can select any number of points on this plot by using a mouse. Detail data of the selected points are shown in the table below,
* Right below the selector panes users get a summary statistics of the variables chosen,
* A data table showing detail about the points selected by the user on the scatter plot.

**Clustering Model:**

* The left pane provides users with selectors to select a subset of movies. The maximum is set fixed at 200 movies to make sure faster performance,
* Users can select two variables of their choice to run clustering. The total number of variables are set fixed at 2 to make sure a 2D plot can be drawn to show the clusters,
* Users can select optimum numbers of clusters to create based on looking at the `Elbow Plot`,
* Right pane shows the clusters with the ID of the clusters and row number of the movies,
* The data table at the bottom shows the movie details along with their cluster numbers. Filter the movies based on cluster and see the actual data of the movies.

## Installation
